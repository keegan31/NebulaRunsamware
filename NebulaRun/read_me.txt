This Ransomware Wasnt Planned To Be Published But Due To Reports Of Attacks Since I Uploaded It To Virustotal Just To See Its Power 
Some People Somehow Got Their Hands On It And Used It For Malicious Purposes.
And I Didnt Like It So Yeah I just Reported My Ransomware To Some AntiVirus Companies Also I Will Be Making Decryptor But It Will Be Hard Since The KEY&IV Is Generated Randomly.


How Can I Decrypt My Files?
U can Contact me and Provide Me Your Victim ID and I Will Be Making Decryptor,
But If You cant Contact Me  Try Running The Ransomware With Your WI-FI Closed It checks For Connection to The Webhook If It succeeds It Sends The KEY&IV,
If It Cant It Will Save The  KEY&IV In %temp% With .txt extension and Random Name  As I Remember.
